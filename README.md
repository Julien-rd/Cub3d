Description
Project: NetPractice

NetPractice is a practical networking exercise focusing on TCP/IP addressing fundamentals. You have to complete 10 levels of network configuration challenges by fixing non-functioning network diagrams through proper configuration.

Instructions

1. Open `index.html`  on your browser
2. For each level: modify the fields to fix the network
3. Click to verify your configuration
4. Click to export your configuration file

During evaluation, you'll have to complete 3 random levels (from level 6-10) with limited time and no external tools.
